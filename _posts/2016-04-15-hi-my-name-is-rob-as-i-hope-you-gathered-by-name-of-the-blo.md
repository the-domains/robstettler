description: "Hi, my name is Rob as I hope you gathered by name of the blog. This first post is going to provide the concept of the blog. I intend to make this primarily about what I find interesting and important in today's world and hopefully talk with you about these topics. This will vary anywhere from SpaceX to Bernie Sanders. Yes, there will be a good amount of my opinions and depending on the topic I will provide a very eloquent write up of my reasoning, and I am always open to being wrong so please tell me when you disagree and why."

It has been a while since I did any blogging. I tried Wordpress and Blogger with various subjects and at the end of the day it felt like I spent more time trying to make the site look and flow in a way that matched the content. When I saw TheGrid a long while ago I was excited about it and immediately bought into the program, and as of yesterday it became my turn to become an actual user, so here I am starting at it again and I hope you enjoy.
