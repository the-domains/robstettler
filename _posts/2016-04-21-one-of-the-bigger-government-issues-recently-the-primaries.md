description: "One of the bigger government issues recently (the primaries aside) has been around Apple refusal to help the FBI unlock the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone. Now many people, my family included, have said why doesn't Apple just unlock the phone problem solved. Unfortunately it is not that simple. Modern operating system designs like iOS and Windows 10 all revolve around the concept of single product design. This means there wont be a Windows 15 or any kind of iOS plus, but instead the setup is designed to establish a standard by which everyone can rely upon. This means that support is easier and cheaper because you really only support the latest version and further more apps focus most of their effort on functionality with the latest version. "

One of the bigger government issues recently (the primaries aside) has been around Apple refusal to help the FBI unlock the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone. Now many people, my family included, have said why doesn't Apple just unlock the phone problem solved. Unfortunately it is not that simple. Modern operating system designs like iOS and Windows 10 all revolve around the concept of single product design. This means there wont be a Windows 15 or any kind of iOS plus, but instead the setup is designed to establish a standard by which everyone can rely upon. This means that support is easier and cheaper because you really only support the latest version and further more apps focus most of their effort on functionality with the latest version. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dda41daf-7bbf-42d7-9303-b80932be9114.jpg)

Now the problem with this is security. The more people use a single type of operating system there has to be more value placed on the security, so Apple made iOS extremely secure. That is not to say there aren't ways into an iPhone, but those get fixed and when they do get fixed are fixed for everyone. Which also means that if Apple needs to directly access any iPhone, they can't because if Apple could then anyone could. Think of it as a castle you build these big walls and a moat but if you build that escape tunnel out someone could find that and skip all of your defenses to get inside. It is the same concept with the FBI asking Apple to get into an iPhone. It isn't that one iPhone but all iPhones that would be vulnerable. 

The solution the FBI came up with was to pay some white hat hackers for software that would allow them to access the specific phone/iOS combination associated with the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone. They spent a million dollars on this solution, and it will only work on an iPhone 5C running a specific version of iOS 9\. This is not a scale able solution obviously, but having Apple provide a more permanent solution compromises the security of your iPhone. I have little problem with the government getting access to my personal device my concern is that in doing so means anyone that wants to get into my phone can.
